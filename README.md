is_palindrome.js

This code implements the is_palindrome() function in JavaScript. The function checks if a word is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word that can be read from left to right or from right to left.

The function works by recursively comparing the first and last characters of the word. If the characters are not equal, then the function returns False. Otherwise, the function recursively checks the rest of the word.

The function stops when the word is empty or when the length of the word is 1. In these cases, the function returns True, as any empty word or word containing a single character is a palindrome.# Recursion-Checkpoint
